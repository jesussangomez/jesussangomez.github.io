Well, since I remember technology was just a part of me. Even with a couple years old I was asked to program the TV channels and that just excited me. My first contact with a computer was in kindergarten, I only remember watching to the teacher doing stuff but I was really happy watching. Then when I was in elementary school I met Windows 3.1, it was awesome to me. My mind is kinda blurry but at that time I learned a couple commands on **MS-DOS** and **LOGO** language (you know the one with the turtle).

Anyway, it was not until I was in high school when I have my first own computer, it had Microsoft Windows 98, a 13.7 Gb hard drive and only 64 Mb but I loved and as curious as I am, I broke the sound system a couple days after and my parents have to call to the tech guy to repair it, of course he only put the drivers disk on the computer an install them; man, that just pissed me off and since that day I swear to the universe and all the mighty gods that every thing I broke on that computer no matter what I would repair it myself.
