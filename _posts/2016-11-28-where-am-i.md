Well, since I remember, technology was just a part of me. Even with a couple years old my family asked me to program the TV channels and that just excited me. My first contact with a computer was in kindergarten, I only remember watching to the teacher doing stuff but I was really happy with that. Then when I was in elementary school I met Windows 3.1, it was awesome to me. My mind is kinda blurry but at that time I learned a couple commands on **MS-DOS** and **LOGO** language (you know, the one with the turtle).

Anyway, it was not until I was in high school when I had my first own computer, it had Microsoft Windows 98 installed, a 13.7 Gb hard drive and only 64 Mb of RAM, but I loved it, then I broke the sound system a couple days after and my parents had to call to the tech guy to repair it, of course he only put the driver's disk on the computer an install them again; man, that just pissed me off and since that day I swear to the universe and to all the mighty gods that every thing I broke on that computer no matter what I would repair it myself.
